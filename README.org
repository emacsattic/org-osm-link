* org-osm --- OSM maps in Org mode

  =osm-maps.el= provides functions to produce SVG images for tracks.  Tracks are
  made of pairs of coordinates.

  Currently, two basic uses are possible:

  1. Create an SVG image, that uses the tiles online on the openstreetmap.org
     servers.
  2. Download the tiles to a local directory and produce SVG images, that use
     those local image tiles as background.


* Aims

  - Configure zoom levels and areas to cache the images for.  But still produce
    SVGs with online tiles for tracks outside of those areas.
  - Produce a draggable JavaScript map on HTML export.
  - Reuse the draggable JavaScript map to draw new tracks.
  - Allow for POIs.
  - Draw kilometer or mile markers.
  - Configure a start and destination icons.


* Ideas

  - Allow multiple tracks on one map.
  - Draw a legend.
